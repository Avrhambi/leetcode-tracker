# PatternPilot

Local-first NeetCode 150 practice tracker. React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, Dexie/IndexedDB,
plain CSS. No server, no auth, no network calls — all data lives in the browser.

## Commands

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server (first free port from 8080)
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc -b`
- `npm test -- --run` — unit tests once (Vitest); `npm test` for watch mode
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run verify` — lint → typecheck → tests once → build. **Run before every commit.**

Runtime: Node.js 22.12+, npm, one committed `package-lock.json`.

The test environment is pure Node: **no `indexedDB`, no `document`**. Pure logic lives in
`src/services/*.ts` and is unit-tested; components and Dexie migrations are verified by
running the app, not in-process.

## Dependencies

Do not add a dependency without asking first, and explain why existing code can't solve it.

- **Runtime:** `react`, `react-dom`, `dexie`, `dexie-react-hooks`.
- **Dev:** `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `typescript`, `eslint`, `@eslint/js`,
  `typescript-eslint`, `vitest`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`.

## Key files

- `src/services/` — pure, **deterministic, unit-tested** rules. No I/O. `reviews.ts`
  (quality + review stage), `dailyPlan.ts` (adaptive plan selection), `mastery.ts`,
  `streak.ts` (grace days), `gamification.ts` (XP/levels), `badges.ts`,
  `attemptForm.ts` (outcome→field rules), `constants.ts` (every threshold and curve),
  `topicPath.ts` (topic-map route geometry — pure, so placement is deterministic),
  `statusLabels.ts` (display-only names for the stored `ProgressStatus` enum — the
  enum itself is persisted and must not be renamed; see `docs/SPEC.md`).
- `src/db/` — **direct Dexie calls only**, no repository/adapter/factory/queue/cache/retry.
  `database.ts` holds the versioned schema + migrations; `saveAttempt.ts` writes attempt +
  progress + recommendation completion + XP + badges in **one transaction**; `backup.ts`
  is JSON export/restore with `formatVersion` validation; `seedCatalog.ts` seeds the
  bundled catalog on first launch.
- `src/data/` — `catalog.ts` + `neetcode150.json`: the 150-problem catalog (metadata +
  links only, **never problem text**). `topicTiers.ts` maps each topic to a curriculum
  tier. The `[INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT]` build warning for `catalog.ts` is known and benign.
- `src/hooks/` — `useDailyPlan.ts`, `useGamification.ts` (thin `useLiveQuery` wrappers).
- `src/components/` — one file per screen/panel. Plain React, no state library beyond
  Dexie's `useLiveQuery`. `Overlay.tsx` is the single modal shell (Settings and the
  daily challenge both use it) — don't write a second one.
- `src/styles/` — `../../tokens.css` (oklch dark "phosphor green" design tokens),
  `global.css`, `gamification.css` (`@import`ed from `global.css`). Plain CSS.
- `docs/` — `SPEC.md` (behaviour spec), `SCHEMA.md` (data model), `MILESTONES.md`,
  `QA.md` (manual test cases), `design/algorithm.md` (the adaptive coach + gamification
  algorithm in full). Keep these in sync with behaviour changes.

## Architecture invariants

- **Dexie migrations are append-only versions.** A `db.version(n).upgrade(cb)` callback
  never re-runs for a user already at `n`, and a fresh install is created at the highest
  version and skips all callbacks. New backfill logic is always a new version, never a
  re-edit of an existing one. Explain migration impact before changing the data model.
- **One attempt save = one transaction** (`saveAttempt.ts`): attempt row, progress
  update, matching daily-recommendation completion, XP award, badge check — all atomic.
- **Level and badge state are derived, not stored where they can drift.** Level is
  `floor(sqrt(xp / 50))`, computed on read. Badges are a monotonic union — never
  un-earned. XP is the only persisted gamification number, and it is reconstructible from
  the `attempts` history alone (`replayXp`), which the Dexie v3 migration and backup
  restore both rely on.
- **All recommendation and review rules are deterministic and unit-tested.** No
  wall-clock reads inside the pure functions — dates are passed in as `YYYY-MM-DD` local
  strings.
- **The page never scrolls.** The shell is a fixed `100dvh` grid with `overflow:
  hidden` on `html`/`body`; anything that can grow scrolls inside its own box (the
  side panel, the full-screen problem view, a modal body). The topic map instead
  *scales*: it is an SVG on a fixed viewBox, so it fits any box by construction and
  needs no per-width tuning. Verify layout changes in a browser — `npm run verify`
  cannot see overflow, and "the page doesn't scroll" can pass while content is
  crushed, overlapping, or (for the map) scaled into illegibility. See `docs/QA.md`,
  "Responsive and production", for the assertions that actually discriminate.
- **All animation sits behind `prefers-reduced-motion`.** The global rule in `global.css`
  clamps durations; showy gamification animations additionally get `animation: none`.

## Conventions

- IDs: `crypto.randomUUID()`. Dates: `YYYY-MM-DD` local-time string keys.
- IndexedDB only — no server, auth, external API, telemetry, AI model, scraping, or
  browser extension.
- External problem links: new tab, `rel="noreferrer"`.
- Caught failures render inline with a single explicit Retry button.
- Search debounce: 200 ms. Every other form action: no debounce.
- Responsive breakpoint: 720 px.

## Automation

`.claude/settings.json` runs `npm run lint && npm run typecheck` after every Edit/Write.
It does not build or run tests — do that yourself via `npm run verify` before committing.

## Delivery

Atomic PRs off `master`, one workstream each, never commit direct to `master`. Each PR
passes `npm run verify`. Commit messages: `<module>: <what and why>`, one logical change
per commit.
